Google Docs introduces an assistive feature that tries to enable writers to use more inclusive language, which is a good thing.  However, some of it's attempts at inclusive language backfire by selecting words that are worse or a completely wrong fit (like using the term motherboard when describing a computer part is tagged as insensitive). It can end up suggesting changes for historical speeches or quotes.  It can harden users against the idea of inclusive language altogether.  It can also help user who DO mean racist, sexist, etc. language to hide their intentions (as the article indicates can fuel the use of dog whistles).
