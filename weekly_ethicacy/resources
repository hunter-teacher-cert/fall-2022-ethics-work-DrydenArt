If we are to add this article re: art competition, I believe it helps us make broader points about the technology:

Possible Topic:  Artifical Intelligence in the Arts
Cons: 
Infringement/Theft of Intellectual Property, Apropriation, Abuse of Power
Examples: 
-AI Rapper (initially collaborated with, they took his voice, his songs and he was not credited or compensated, or aware that the project was progressing, company engaged in racist marketing to promote project)
-AI artist winning art contest (typed in words to make a composite from artwork found on the internet, artists were not credited or compensated, or even aware)
-both of these examples take from others without compensation
-mega companies abuse their power by excluding the artists behind the work
-perpetuates racism, appropriation, sexism, etal, and other exclusionary practices

Pros:
helps to evolve how we see, respond to and consume art, allows for anyone to enter the art world (traditional and digital/new technologies),Social media and watchdog organizations are able to keep major companies accountable, and help artists have a voice when they engage in racism/sexism/corrupt practices
Examples: 
-Industry Blackout's strong and effective response
-social media empowers humanity to play the role of watchdog against abuses of power from companies or individuals
-throughout history as technological advances developed in the arts, there has always been backlash (camera evolution (obscura, film, digital), photoshop, digital video editing software)
-don't hate the technology, hate the companies who cut artists out of the process or engage in racist/sexist/et al behaviors
