# What it is:
All Trails and the Hiking Project are apps that help you find and hike trails around your location, and all over the world.  Both apps are designed to encourage and support people getting outside and enjoying nature.  Both apps are generally crowdsourced from user contributions, data sharing and commenting.  
# Data Collection: 
Both apps collect similar information such as location, personally identifiable information provided when creating your accounts, and how you use their site.   Both apps run various contests to entice users to share more information.  Any information provided by the user is shared with third party affiliates.  Both apps are clear that they are almost always sharing the information you provide with their third party affiliates, and if you choose to log in using another source (such as Google, Facebook, etc), that opens the door to additional sharing. Both companies state that, while you can opt out, it may make using the site inopperable.  
# Contrasts
All Trails mentions that they do not sell your personal information, but they do use your information and how you use the site to personalize advertisements for you.  There are levels of the app which you need a subsciption for in order to eliminate the ads, beyond the free interface.  Much of the usability of the site (such as downloading maps to use offline) are only available through a paid subscription.  While All Trails collects data that would be typical of this kind of app, it also connects to your biometric data through other devices such as an Apple Watch or Garmin, unless you opt out.

While the Hiking Project is always free, the also sell your data, as well as share your data with their third party affiliates.
