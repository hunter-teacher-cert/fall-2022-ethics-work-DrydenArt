# Gamification of Life

## Topic Description
Gamification has invaded many aspects of our online lives.  What seems like playful and harmless features can also be used to hijack our attention. Corporations use gamification to increase the time we spend on their services and thus add revenues. Gamification is a standard feature of many educational apps and practices.  We will explore the thorny issues that arise with gamification in our presnetation.

- BF Skinner and Behaviorism: a psychologist who invented the idea of behavioralism.  Believed that people will do things either because they're being rewarded or punished for something.  ex: the Skinner Box - you're able to provide reward or punishment to a rat/subject in a controlled setting.  Behaviorism has been discredited because there are a lot of reasons we do things, not just reward or punishment.  We also do things based on social constructs, satisfaction, self-determination, autonomy/agency, connectedness to help others, mastery to practice somethings to see progress.  These are more about something deeper than reward/punishment. However, education and behaviorism have been intricately linked throughout history.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner

## What is Gamification? 
"The use of game mechanics such as points, badges, leaderboards, missions, quests, achievements for non-game purposes," Adrian Hon.  Initially thought of as a way to reimagine our society by making things that are hard to do more fun. 

Only started appearing about 15 years ago due to the proliferation of cell phones, the Internet, online data. May have been a response to the vilification of video game culture that was becoming more popular and also perceived as negative. The term gamification started to be noticed around 2011.

**Gamification in my life:**  Running apps talking to me about distance, pace, etc.   Local running challenge that uses a leaderboard to help motivate each other, plus community badges for running with a partner, as well as local shopper awards for shopping near each run [link](https://fingerlakesrunners.org/challenge/). APPR at school.  ADK 46er badge for hiking all 46 High Peaks.  Fingerlakes Trail Hiking Series and badge, Tompkins County, 2022. Merlin app, Cornell Lab of Ornithology collecting Bird IDs within the app.  

**Gamification in school:** Kahoot, Kahn Academy, Duolino, design challenges, 

**Gamification in self improvement:** Step counters, calorie counters, strava, mindfulness, streaks, challenge medals, 

**Gamification to make more money:** A way to make more money by using the app more, offering incentives to stay on the app (even when a rest day is better for your health re: running or fitness), brain training apps (not grounded in research) ex: lumosity, were fined for making unfounded claims that their site would improve brain function.  Companies like Gamify.com are marketing to corporations (or any other possible customer such as governments, schools) to use gamification.  They spend a lot of energy creating content used to convince companies to create an account and begin a culture of gamification in their companies. 

**Creepy Gamification:** Gamification in workplaces, quests, underpaid/gig economy employing gamification to make workers strive for additional money making missions (makes the calculation of wages very complicated and confusing to workers), also the casino-ication of various apps the missions can be completely out of your control where you may try to achieve them but your opportunities may fall short of the goal.  Infantizing workers, making them into playthings, rather than just offering opportunities for work/pay you have to engage in a game.  It keeps workers from being able to address compensation/pay with the managers/owners of a company. Allows the company to save money by creating all these games for pay, rather than developing real achievable, predicatable ways of making money.  

**Gamification in government:** China's social credit score, hooks into a lot of data the city collects (volunteering history, traffic accidents, breaking the law, etc.), Financial credit scores, health insurance credit scores, auto/home insurance credit scores, 

**Gamification in Disinformation:** Qanon, people saying "I did my research and that's why I follow Qanon"  the concept of that doing a Google search can equate research/being informed, looks like an alternate reality game.  Clues were dropped keeping people anticipating information, speculatign about "dropped" clues, making it a game/puzzle to be decoded and discovered as a way of "figuring out the news" or "the truth."  Feeds into deep rooted conspiracy theories and fears via game play.

**Studying Gamification:** Hard to study because all forms of gamification are very different and therefore are hard to compare.  A lot of gamification is very generic and repetitive.  It becomes boring over a short period of time and doesn't really work long term. Gamification may not be able to increase workplace satisfaction or productivity, but it can be used to cut pay for workers. Seems to be a problem that needs to be addressed, people need to be skeptical about these practices because it doesn't really work for the person involved but can work for the peole in charge in order to make them more money or to control their behavior.

## Description of Proposed Code Example
A website that uses javascript to simulate the experience of gamification for the visitor in a somewhat absurdist way.  Building off how sites like Khan Academy award badges and points, our site will do the same for simple and inane tasks. The site will give visitors a sens of how long they spend on a task and confront them with  questions on whether they spend more time on these tasks because of gamification.  Possibly letting them see the sites without gamification features turned on.
